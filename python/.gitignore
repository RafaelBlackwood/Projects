# pyenv
# For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
# According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
# However, in case of collaboration, if one does not want to include it, one can uncomment the following lines to ignore it.
# Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
